**Quantumcomputers**
   Schrödingers wave equation
   From basics to wave equation to code

The Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation of quantum mechanics. 
It describes the time variation of a quantum mechanical state in a non-relativistic system.

We will first open with some basics needed to understand Schrödingers wave equation. 
Based on this, the equation will be derived and explained step by step.

The last step is to convert this formula into code, the challenge is to connect the physics world with the computer science world.
There were two different approaches to try and overcome this hurdle.



# Physical basics
Unfortunately, an average computer scientist has little understanding of physics, so some basics must be understood in advance in order to understand Schrödinger's equation.


## Complex numbers
Since wave functions are represented by complex numbers, these must be understood in advance, for this you can refer to the [Complex Numbers README](../Complex%20Numbers/README.md).


## Differential Equation & Partial Differential Equation
Differential equations describe the temporal evolution of a physical system. 

The **Differential Equation** is an equation or a system of equations that consists of the function $y(x)$ and its derivatives. 
The unknown function $y$ depends on the variable $x$. 
In this case, $x$ can be a location, for example.

The **partial differential equation** differs in that our function $y$ now depends on several variables (e.g., location and time). 

*Example*:
$$F(x_1, x_2, y(x_1, x_2), \frac{\partial (x_1, y_2)}{\partial x_1}, \frac{\partial (x_1, x_2)}{\partial x_2}, \frac{\partial^2 (x_1, x_2)}{\partial x_1 \partial x_2}, ...) = 0$$


## Nonrelativistic System
A non-relativistic system is a system which is not influenced by the relativity theory. 
Simply said, it is our perception, because we can only perceive things that are influenced by our perception.



# Schrödinger's wave equation
Schrödinger's wave equation is the foundation of almost all practical applications of quantum mechanics. The wave equation describes the change of a physical, non-relativistic state.
The wave equation describes a physical state, this is achieved via a function that changes its shape depending on time, this creates a type of wave, hence the name wave equation. 
The goal of the equation is to calculate the energy levels of physical states.


## The simplest (time-independent) form of the Schrödinger equation
$$\widehat{H}\Psi=E\Psi$$

$\widehat{H}$ stands for the **Hamilton operator**. The operator is the equivalent to the Hamilton function of classical physics. 
It is the energy operator of quantum mechanics and gives energy measurements + time evolution. 
The operator changes continuously and is applied to an entire function ($\Psi$), transforming the function into another.

$$\widehat{H}=\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}∇^2 + V$$

    * $\hbar$: reduced Planck-Constant (*Typical for quantum mechanical calculations*)
    * $m$: Mass
    * $∇$: Nabla (*Derivative according to spatial coordinates, see Partial Differential Equation*)
        - $∇^2$: Laplace-Operator (*Twofold derivation according to spatial coordinates*)
    * $V$: Potential Energy

$\Psi$ is a **function** which depends on space ($x$) and time ($t$).

$E$ stands for an energy eigenvalue of the operator $\widehat{H}$ with respect to the function $\Psi$.


## Completion of the Schrödinger equation
If we leave $E$ as it is now, the wave function would be **static**, but this cannot produce waves, it lacks dependence on time. 
Therefore we convert $E$ into an **operator**, so that the height of the energy affects the oscillation speed of the wave function:

$$E=i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t}$$

    * $i$: imaginary constant ($\sqrt{-1}$)
    * $\hbar$: reduced Planck constant
    * $\frac{\partial}{\partial t}$: partial derivative after time ($t$)


## Complete Schrodinger equation
This is now the one-dimensional (only one spatial coordinate $x$) and time-dependent ($t$) Schrodinger equation:

$$(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} ∇^2 + V) \Psi(x, t) = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x, t)$$

We have now written out the Hamilton operator ($\widehat{H}$) in the first bracket. 
Both $\Psi$ are dependent on location ($x$) & time ($t$), while $E$ is also seen in its written out form.

Lastly, we can write out the Laplace operator ($∇^2$)

$$(-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + V) \Psi(x, t) = i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(x, t)$$



# From the equation to the code
Now we would like to find out step by step how we can simulate the Schrödinger equation. 
For this we have to solve the Schrödinger equation, for which there are several approaches.


## First approach 

### Reduced Schrödinger equation
$$-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi + V \Psi = i \frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi$$

### Timestepping function
The Schrödinger equation is a continuous equation, which is constantly changing. 
However, a simulation must discretize time & place. For this we need to specify values for distance ($\Delta x$) and time ($\Delta t$) per step. 
We now want to find a **timestepping function** which can calculate the time steps $\Delta t$ individually.

By transformations & derivations one can now come to the following timestepping function:

$$\Psi_{\Delta t+1} \simeq \Psi_{\Delta t} -i\Delta t(-\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi + V \Psi)$$

The Laplace operator is calculated using a [**Finite difference method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method), which are methods to solve (or approximate) differential equations. 
Connected with the timestepping function we now come to the following:

$$\frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} \Psi(x, t) \simeq \frac{\Psi(x + \Delta x,t) + \Psi(x - \Delta x,t) - 2\Psi(x,t)}{\Delta x^2}$$

### Practical implementation & Result

**Implementation:** *TODO*

**Result:** If we implement the timestepping function found above, then we encounter several problems in the simulation.
The absolute probability of the electrons increases with time, which should not be possible. 
In addition, the oscillations also become more and more erroneous with time.


## New attempt with the Split-step method
We try now the whole again with a new procedure the time-dependent Schördingergleichung to solve.
For this we use the [**Split-step method**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-step_method).

### New timestepping function
*TODO*

### Practical implementation & Result
*TODO*
