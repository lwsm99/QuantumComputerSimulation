# Simulation von Quantencomputern und ihren Grundlagen - Lucas Wei√ümann
This is a Repo for the Course "Simulation von Quantencomputern und ihren Grundlagen" at THM for the winter term 2022/2023. 

## Complex Numbers
In order to approach quantum computing we started coding a library for complex numbers. It contains basic arithmetic operators but also conjugate and the absolute value while also supporting the polar form besides the algebraic form.

The goal was to incorporate the idea of conceptual programming, which in short means that you want to tell a narrative with the code rather than having the most efficient code possible.
